# Context / Description

This repo contains a single code file and a single associated test file. Nearly the simplest node.js project you can start off with.

I'm using this as a starting template for a pair-programming coding interview.

## How to Run the Tests
  * In `package.json` there is a script that will run every test in the `/test` directory. You can run this script via:
      - `npm run test`
